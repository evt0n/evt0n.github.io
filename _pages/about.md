I’m 28 years old. I created this page to share about some subjects, like DevOps, my journey in IT or “Information Technology”, and things like that. 

Graduated in Computer System Information, currently I’m passionate about technology, problem solver, and critical thinker.

The idea is share in this page my studies and learnings about Linux, DevOps, Infrastructure, Development and technology in general.
